    "Methane (CH4) emissions are increasing globally. Yet, partitioning different sources of methane emissions remains challenging due to the limited spatial and temporal scale of field measurements. Improving ground measurements of CH4 flux will allow us to identify and quantify how different policy and management actions can reduce emissions. In order to increase ground measurements of CH4 flux, we need affordable, rugged, and portable sensors that can be deployed for days to weeks at a time. This webpage documents the design, construction, and field testing of 10 prototype chambers to measure CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from a variety of environments (e.g., manure, wetlands, lakes, agricultural fields). The development of these affordable, portable, rugged, and easy to use chambers will expand ground CH4 flux measurements world-wide, ultimately providing much-needed science to inform carbon policy.\n",
